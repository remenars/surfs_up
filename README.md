Statistics for December:

* The minimum temperatures for both June and December are high enough that people might want ice cream year round
* The average temperatures for both June and December are around 70 degrees and great for enjoying ice cream
* There's not a significant difference in temperatures from June to December and suggests that the shop will bring in business year round

## Summary
In summary, I would run another query to pull January detail to see how another winter month is fairing. It would be good to see the precipitation detail as well.
